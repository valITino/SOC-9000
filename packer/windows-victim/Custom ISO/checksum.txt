# This file stores the SHA256 checksum of the custom Windows ISO
# The checksum is automatically generated during the ISO creation process
# Format: SHA256(filename)= HASH_VALUE
#
# Note: This file should NOT be committed with a specific checksum value
# as the ISO is generated uniquely on each system. Use this as a template.
#
# Example format:
# SHA256(Win11_24H2_noprompt_autounattend_uefi.iso)= YOUR_CHECKSUM_HERE
